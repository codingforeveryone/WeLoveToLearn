###Make a basic CMS

This is one of a series of 3 beginner friendly projects for 24 Pull Requests: http://24pullrequests.com/.

We want to make a basic content management service for posting, sharing and commenting on thoughts, problems and todos.
Founders & Coders is planning to create an internal service for potential members, students and graduates, however we think the community should get involved.

Think stackoverflow meets facebook at wikipedia place (for beginners).

Feel free to use hapi.js or express.js! Other than that, do whatever you think is best.

The Founders and Coders crew are all more than happy to offer any help, advice, or direction. Feel free to message any of us. Find us here: https://github.com/foundersandcoders.
